			This is the last world cup which was held in Melburn, Australia. The place for the competition hadn't been choosed randomly. Feliks Zemdegs lives in Melburne, he is the best speedcuber in the world, so he has a lot of sponsores, which were the main sponsores of that competiotion. More than 1000 people took part in that competiotion.

			where the competition held. There you will get a badge with your name and the schedule of the competition and groups in which you take part. In order the competition held in a propriate way, you can help with scrambling and judgement. Scrumblers have to scramble cubes in the same way for all competitors of the particular group in order to all competitiors have the same condition.

		<H2>Solving the puzzle</H2>
			As i mentioned before, there are 18 disciplines in wca comps. So the flow of judgement and solving is quite the same for all of them. Firstly the judge takes your scrumbleed cube, covers it with some box and calls you. Next you sit at the special table with a timer(Fig. 1). After that you have to confirm that you are ready, after that the judje will take that covering box away and starts his own timer. You will have 15 seconds to inspect the cube and think about you first steps. Next you put your hands on timer(you "say" to timer that you are ready), get your hands out of timer and start solving, as soon as you finish you have to put your hands on timer again in order to stop the timer. The judge will write your result on paper and return your cube back to scramblers. You have 5 tries in the most cases.

		<H2>Results</H2>
			Due to the WCA regulations, there are 2 main result types: best and average. But average is not smth in regular understanding. WCA averave calculates in the following way: your best and worst solve discards and calculates average of 3 left results. For example, you solved 3x3 and you results are: 12.43, 10.22, 9.97, 7,60, 14.54; the average will be: (12,43 + 10.22 + 9.97)/3. = 10.87
